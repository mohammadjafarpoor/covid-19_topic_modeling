# Project Definition
CORD-19 is a collection of scientific articles related to COVID-19, maintained by the Semantic Scholar team at the Allen Institute to support text mining and natural language processing research. The dataset was introduced in a paper titled "CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset," authored by the team responsible for its curation
## Project objectives

The project aims to address the increasing challenges posed by the high volume and continuously growing online textual data of the CORD-19 dataset, coupled with the limitations of human reading capacity. In this endeavor, the focus is on employing topic modeling and clustering systems to enhance data comprehension. The objective is to cluster the 19-COVID dataset and extract meaningful relationships between its articles, organizing them based on identified topics
